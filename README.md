# tmm-gen-episodes
Generates empty video files for tv shows to use with tinyMediaManager(tmm)

tmm does not look for your missing episodes, it only manages what you have.
But what if you want to track future episodes and know if you acquired the episode yet or not.

This project looks at your nfo file created by tmm and 
queries the episodes from [thetvdb](http://www.thetvdb.com/) and creates missing episodes for
tmm to find them and start tracking them.

##Features
- Generate all missing episodes for the selected show.

##Usage
WIP

##Todo
- Diff with already existing episode and only generate missing ones.
- allow to search the show without the initial nfo file from tmm
